  Clock.ino
  
  Demonstrates a clock-like display with a very huge font.
  Also shows usage of u8x8_u8toa().

/*
  U8g2lib Example Overview:
    Frame Buffer Examples: clearBuffer/sendBuffer. Fast, but may not work with all Arduino boards because of RAM consumption
    Page Buffer Examples: firstPage/nextPage. Less RAM usage, should work with all Arduino boards.
    U8x8 Text Only Example: No RAM usage, direct communication with display controller. No graphics, 8x8 Text only.
    
  This is a page buffer example.
